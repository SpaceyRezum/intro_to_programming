# Project Details
## Project - Online Resume

1. For this project, I have started with an HTML template build with empty divs and sections. The idea was to understand structured data concepts and how important JSON is. I, therefore, created various theme-specific (bio, work, education & projects) objects to store my personal and professional information meant to be used in my resume.   

2. I built a javascript file using jQuery and other vanilla Javascript functions (and used Udacity's helper.js for HTML markups) to dynamically append the webpage's content to the HTML template.

3. I finally used Udacity's guides to add some extra interactions on my resume (added an interactive map of where I worked and lived with the help of Google Map API, used Bootstrap to make navigation through the page a lot smoother and use some cool fonts to enhance the page's design).

The repository includes the following files:

* **index.html**: The HTML template.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**:  Contains the largest part of my code (structured data + jQuery functions)
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: 
* **bootstrap/ & font-awesome/**
* **images/**
